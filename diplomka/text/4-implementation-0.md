# Software Implementation

This section describes the implementation details of the pipeline projected in the previous chapter.
The aim is to facilitate reproducibility of the results, explain some technical decisions, as well as provide a place to acknowledge and cite other software this project relies on.
Non-technical readers can safely skip the entire chapter, the details are separate from the theory precisely for that reason.
