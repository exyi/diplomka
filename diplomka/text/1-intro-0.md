# Introduction

Nucleic acids are some of the most important molecules of molecular biology, and the study of their structure and function is critical to understanding the fundamental principles of life.
The well known double-stranded helix described by [Watson, Crick, and Franklin](https://doi.org/10.1038/171737a0) dominates DNA structure, protecting its valuable information content.
On the other hand, RNA molecules often form complicated structures, some of them even have catalytic activity independent on proteins.
Similarly to the classic helix, these complex structures are also driven by the pairwise interaction of nucleotide bases.
However, the canonical Watson-Crick G-C and A-T basepairs only account for about one half of the interactions in the RNAs we studied.

* DNA is usually the classic helix described by Watson, Crick, and Franklin back in 1953
* RNA often forms much more complex structures, but also contains the helixes
* RNA helix is usualy A-form, DNA B-form, but the basepairs are practically the same
* 
... At the time of writing we have more than 7 thousand RNA structures in PDB, and almost 2 thousand of them are pure nucleic acid, without any protein
... 

"Only" 61.4% of all found basepairs are canonical Watson-Crick (in all PDB structures < 3.5 Ã…)
