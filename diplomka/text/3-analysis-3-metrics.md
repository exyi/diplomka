## Basepair metrics

The objective of this work is to find and compare decent measures of basepairing, so we shall finally specify what we are looking for.
The main qualities of the metrics are:

* Interpretability - can we easily tell what the number means, can we easily guess the number by looking at the 3D structure?
* Stability - it should have low variance for good quality basepairs.
* Universality - can the same or similar measure be reused for other basepair types?
* Simplicity - the ideal metric is easy to define and calculate algorithmically.
* Independence - it is an advantage, if the metric is empirically independent on other metrics we want to use.

<!-- We need to define basepairs in such a way, that humans can easily understand the results of computer calculations. -->

It is important that humans can easily understand why a computer cannot Interpretability is important for 


### Number of parameters

The relative position of two bases can be completely described by six numbers â€” three for translation of a reference frame, three for their relative rotation (using three Euler angles).
However, such description
