## Basepair Isostericity

One of the primary motivations for studying basepairs is to improve our understanding of mutations within structured nucleic acids.
It is widely known that the canonical **G-C** and **A-U** pairs are similar in shape, with nearly identical distance and angle between glycosidic bonds.
Consequently, a mutation from **G** to **A** can be effectively reversed by mutating the complementary **C** to **U**, without significant change in the sugar-phosphate backbone.

The aforementioned publication also incorporates similarity tables for the entire cWW family, which can be found in Tables 3 and 5.

Even non-canonical basepairing classes form groups with equivalent geometric configurations, we call this equivalence [**isostericity**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.06.031).
The similarity can be quantified using [the IsoDiscrepancy index](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp011), which assesses the distance between C1' atoms, basepair structure and a rotation between the glycosidic bonds.
The publication also includes similarity tables for the entire cWW family, which can be found in Tables 3 and 5.
