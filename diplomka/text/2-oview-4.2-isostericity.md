## Basepair Isostericity

One of the primary motivations for studying basepairs is to improve our understanding the biological role of mutations in nucleic acid structures.
It is widely known that the canonical **G-C** and **A-U** pairs are similar in their overall shape with nearly identical distance and angle between the two glycosidic bonds.
Consequently, a mutation from **G** to **A** can be effectively reversed by mutating the complementary **C** to **U**, without significant change in the sugar-phosphate backbone.
Even non-canonical basepairing classes form groups with equivalent geometric configurations, we call this equivalence [**isostericity**]
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2014.06.031).
More complicated substitutions of one non-canonical basepair to another require further analysis but first of all, a reliable assignment of all pair classes.
The similarity of basepairs can be quantified using [the IsoDiscrepancy index]
(https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp011), which assesses the distance
between C1' atoms, basepair structure, and a rotation between the glycosidic bonds.
