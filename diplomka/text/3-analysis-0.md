# Selection of New Parameters {#sec:data-analysis}

This chapter focuses on presenting our results -- the new basepair parameters as well as the reasoning behind their selection.
We aim for finding interpretable definitions of the Leontis-Westhof classes, with the new parameters at the core.
More technical details of our methods, including code listings, can be found in [the following chapter @sec:impl].

Most importantly, the parameter definitions are presented in @sec:basepair-params, while [section @sec:testing-basepair-params] discusses their performance.
In [@sec:tuning-app], we introduce the [basepairs.datmos.org](https://basepairs.datmos.org){.link-no-footnote} web application, which will aid us in defining the L-W basepair using these parameters.

The "Selection of New Parameters" chapter appears to introduce an innovative methodology for examining and describing basepairs in nucleic acid structures. It references older software like Curves+ used for calculating standard basepair parameters, and suggests an improvement to these methods for ensuring symmetry in parameter values. This new method takes into account the average of two reference frames and considers the bases' relative positions from this average, which leads to more consistent computations of rotations or translations.

Additionally, the chapter likely includes specifics about a new set of parameters created for basepair assignment. It emphasizes the importance of careful parameter selection criteria, which must be fine-tuned to gain acceptance within the structural biology community. Furthermore, the chapter introduces an interactive tool for visualizing and comparing parameter distributions. This web-based application facilitates the manual tuning of parameters post-processing, making it an essential tool for researchers looking to explore and validate basepair classifications. -->
