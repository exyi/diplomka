# Selection of New Parameters {#sec:data-analysis}

This chapter focuses on presenting our results -- the new basepair parameters as well as the reasoning behind them.
We aim finding interpretable definitions of the Leontis-Westhof classes, with the new parameters at the core.
More the technical details of our methods can be found in [the following chapter @sec:impl] ..., hopefully making this one accessible to non-programmers??.

Most importantly, the parameter definitions are presented in @sec:basepair-params, while [section @sec:testing-basepair-params] discusses their performance.
In [@sec:tuning-app], we introduce the [basepairs.datmos.org](https://basepairs.datmos.org){.link-no-footnote} web application, which will aid us in defining the L-W basepair using the new parameters.

The "Selection of New Parameters" chapter appears to introduce an innovative methodology for examining and describing basepairs in nucleic acid structures. It references older software like Curves+ used for calculating standard basepair parameters, and suggests an improvement to these methods for ensuring symmetry in parameter values. This new method takes into account the average of two reference frames and considers the bases' relative positions from this average, which leads to more consistent computations of rotations or translations.

Additionally, the chapter likely includes specifics about a new set of parameters created for basepair assignment. It emphasizes the importance of careful parameter selection criteria, which must be fine-tuned to gain acceptance within the structural biology community. Furthermore, the chapter introduces an interactive tool for visualizing and comparing parameter distributions. This web-based application facilitates the manual tuning of parameters post-processing, making it an essential tool for researchers looking to explore and validate basepair classifications. -->
