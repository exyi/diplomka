# Overview

The concept of basepairing is known to essentially every biologist, and it is therefore unsurprising that many publications have been written and published dealing with basepairs and their geometries.
This chapter concentrates only on the background necessary for this work, specifically, established categorization of basepairs (@sec:bp-terminology).
The chapter also covers existing software for determining basepairs in 3D molecular structures, including some general approaches to describing basepairs (@sec:software).
