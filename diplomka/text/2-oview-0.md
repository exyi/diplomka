# Overview

The concept of basepairing is known to essentially every biologist, and it is therefore unsurprising that this is not the first publication about basepairs.
Most importantly, this chapter covers the background necessary for this work, such as the established categorization of non-canonical basepairs (@sec:bp-terminology).
It also covers existing software for determining basepairs in 3D molecular structures, including some general approaches to measuring basepairs.
