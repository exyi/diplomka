# Conclusions

We have defined a comprehensive set of 

### Future work

Our team is already busy expanding the work in @sec:testing-basepair-params, and defining all basepair classes using the proposed new parameters.
This will allow us to create new method for basepair assignment.

The web-based basepair browser primarily for exploring various types of basepairs in the entire database.
We also plan to integrate the basepairing information into the [DNATCO web server](https://dnatco.datmos.org), designed to [explore and validate individual structures](https://doi.org/10.1107/S2059798318000050).
DNATCO currently focuses on the nucleic acid backbone structure, disregarding the importance of base interactions.
This work, on the other hand, ignores the sugar and phosphate conformation, but merging the understanding of both will hopefully lead to new insights into the nucleic acid structural biology.
